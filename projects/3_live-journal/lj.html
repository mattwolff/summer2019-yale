    <ul>
      <li>
        There should be 4 unique HTML files, one each day: July 4, 5, 6, and 7.
      </li>
      <li>
        These 4 files should link together, so devise some sort of Forwards and/or Backwards navigation system. A means of accessing the next or previous page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to focus on content first. If you're eager to move on to CSS, go ahead. Your content on the four pages doesn't need to be serial or repetitive, each one can be drastically different from the last.
